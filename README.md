# Build of this plugin
This is how to build the plugin and install it in your local repository

To build from the build server and install it in artifactory

    ./gradlew clean artifactoryPublish

# Usage of the plugin
Include this in the **build.gradle** file

Example of buildscript addition:

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()
            maven { url "https://ssl.nordija.com/artifactory/NordijaCentral"
                credentials {
                    username = gradleUsername
                    password = gradlePassword
                }
            }
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url "http://download.java.net/maven/2/" }
            maven { url "http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2" }
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath group: 'com._24i', name: 'gitMavenVersioning', version: '1.0.+'
        }
    }

Example of usage:

    apply plugin: 'com._24i.versionManager'

Two tasks can be called:

**showVersion** will display information about the values generated by the plugin.

**findVersion** will store all the information in the System.properties. all properties can be seen by showVersion

**printVersion** will print the project.version

A parameter called CI can be set to true if the plugin is running on a CI server. This will not try to call the remote origin for finding the parent branches. 
The gradle command needs to be called like this:

    -PCI=true
